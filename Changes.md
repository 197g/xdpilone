## v1.1

- Added `DeviceQueue::bind` for binding queues from multiple different
  interfaces to the same underlying `umem`. Previously only a single socket for
  each additional queue could be bound when the same socket set up both
  fill/completion rings as well as receive/transmit rings.
- Note: I'm currently not entirely comfortable with the types of the `bind`
  argument. They are not generic enough to cover all possible usagesâ€”the socket
  of fq/cq socket itself is sufficient but a `User` with rx/tx sockopts is
  required. At the same time however the types barely guard invariants that
  would detect some misuse or failure paths at compile time. Also to-be-used
  bind flags are associated with the socket as a `User` struct not as an
  independent argument to the `bind` call.
- Note: Please open PRs resolving this either way, not issues.

## v1.0.5

- Discovered that the `XdpUmemReg` contains padding, being passed to the kernel
  as the `tx_metadata_len` option. This would should up as spurious invalid
  argument (EINVAL) errors from the interpretation of the field.

## v1.0.4

- No code changes.
- Clarified status as feature-complete, passively maintained.
- Updated some documentation.


## v1.0.3

- Hide an unimplemented function sketch which was accidentally left over from
  previous experiments. Calling it always panics. The method will remain
  accessible for compatibility reasons (SemVer).

## v1.0.2

- Implement `Iterator` for `ReadRx` and `ReadComplete`.
- Document queue interaction adapters with intended workflow.
